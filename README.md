# Image Processing Masks-Convolution

Developing from Scratch Masks that change Images and apply them via Convolution to understand the Basics of Image Processing - Originally developed 04/05/2018



## In this project it was developed 
1. A function that produces a Convolution between two images in the **Spatial Domain** 
2. A function that produces a Convolution between two images in the **Frequency Domain**
3. A Convolution of an Image with a Mask 
4. Convolution of a Mask that creates Motion Bluer in the Image

## What I learned from this Project
This was a great combination between Maths, Engineering, and Programming I understood better Convolution and how to use it in the real world

## What was the project difficulties 
Mainly combining the theory of masks to the real using actual algorithm that is robust to different images
## My solutions
Basically, I needed to go back to understand better the theory and then work again in the same problem in order to make a system that can be implemented in the real world
